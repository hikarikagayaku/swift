    /// `reserveCapacity(_:)` allocates only as much space as you tell it to
    /// (padded to a round value), and no more. This avoids over-allocation, but
    /// can result in insertion not having amortized constant-time performance.
    ///
    /// The following code declares `values`, an array of integers, and the
    /// `addTenQuadratic()` function, which adds ten more values to the `values`
    /// array on each call.

    ///       var values: [Int] = [0, 1, 2, 3]

    ///               values.append(n)
    ///           }

    /// is linear growth. Instead of having constant time when averaged over
    /// many calls, the function may decay to performance that is linear in
    /// `values.count`. This is almost certainly not what you want.
